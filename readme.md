System requirements
- Node.js is not required to run the shipped binaries.
- For local development: Node.js 18+, pnpm or npm, Git.
- Disk: 200 MB free for app data and temp files.
- Memory: 2 GB recommended for standard workloads; more for heavy agent chains.

Configuration
- Config file: ~/.aionui/config.json
- Key settings
  - geminiCliPath: path to the gemini CLI binary
  - defaultAgent: agent profile to load on startup
  - ui.port: port for local webview debug
  - storage.encryption: true/false
- Example config
  {
    "geminiCliPath": "/usr/local/bin/gemini",
    "defaultAgent": "assistant",
    "ui": { "port": 34567 },
    "storage": { "encryption": true }
  }

Gemini CLI integration
- AionUi calls gemini CLI for local model inferencing and streaming outputs into the chat pane.
- Set the gemini CLI path in Settings â†’ Integrations or place a symlink to your PATH.
- Use the terminal tab to run:
  gemini --model=your-model --json <input>
- Live stream: the chat pane listens for stdout events and renders partial tokens.

Common workflows
- Code review
  1. Open project in Project Explorer.
  2. Select two commits or files.
  3. Click "Compare" to open diff viewer.
  4. Use inline comments and create an agent to summarize changes.

- Task chaining
  1. Start a new agent from Agents â†’ New Agent.
  2. Add steps: fetch repo, run tests, summarize results.
  3. Run agent and view step logs in the Agent Monitor.

- Multi-agent coordination
  1. Create agents A and B.
  2. Route A output to B via the "Chain" action.
  3. Observe how B processes A output and produces a final report.

- Local LLM development
  1. Use the built-in terminal to run gemini experiments.
  2. Stream outputs to an editor buffer.
  3. Diff changes and commit directly from project pane.

FAQ
- Q: How do I point to a different Gemini binary?
  A: Set geminiCliPath in Settings or update ~/.aionui/config.json.
